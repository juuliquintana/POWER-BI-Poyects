# PowerBi proyects

This repository contains various data analysis projects conducted with Power BI. Below, you can find links to the corresponding dashboards:

1- *Adidas Sales*
This project was my first project completed in Power BI, and it was part of the final work for the CoderHouse course. It uses a public database on sales from 2020-2021 at Adidas. The project began with data preprocessing to clean the data. If you have any questions about the steps taken, feel free to ask.
